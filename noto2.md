## Flexural rigidity of pressurized model notochords in regular packing patterns

**Project description:** Modeling the developing *D. rerio* notochord as truncated spheres comprised of elastic membranes, we investigated how internal pressure and cortical stiffness influence flexural rigidity in two common packing patterns.
