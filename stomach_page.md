## Morphoelastic models discriminate between different mechanisms of left-right asymmetric stomach morphogenesis

**Project description:** Inspired by the developing *X. laevis* stomach, we investigated how different growth schemes align with the morphology observed *in vivo* using morphoelastic models.

### Radial thinning combined with axial and circumferential expansion induces the expected shape changes
